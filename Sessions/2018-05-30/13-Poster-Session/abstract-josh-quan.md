## Abstract
Use of Carpentry pedagogical principles in peer to peer education at the undergraduate level have helped to further democratize Data Science education and empower young data scientists to be experts and facilitators of knowledge in their own discourse communities. 
I share the experiences of a library undergraduate fellowship program and peer to peer consulting program at UC Berkeley Library launched in Spring 2018 where librarian mentors work with undergraduates in the data sciences interested in peer instruction. We utilized Carpentry principles (Helping novices build mental models, Live coding practices, Cognitive Load, Motivation, etc.) to develop workshops and instruction materials.
